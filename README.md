# Introduction
In this game you play as man who wakes up without any memories inside a house. Your only objective so far is to escape it, but you'll do so with the help of other spirits that reside inside there. Solve the puzzles and discover the truth!

The story of the game is not entirely finished, and the current version available only let's the player go through the first stage of the game, as in the future the outside map could be added as well to give the story closure.

# Art
The art style in this game was based on retro games, mostly 1-bit art and the collor pallette used was from this [website](https://lospec.com/palette-list/noire-truth).

The character color was made to be purple in order to contrast with the background and make it visible. The items used for the inventory and interactions are real life edited images and not made with pixel art.

The software used to make all original sprites was Piskel, that can be downloaded at [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/download).

# Controls
The game was made using Unity's new input system and a grid map, so the player is allowed to move as long as there's an available grid around them. The controls are:
